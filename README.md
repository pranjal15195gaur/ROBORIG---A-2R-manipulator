# RoboRig Adventure Hackathon

## Introduction
Welcome to our submission for the RoboRig Adventure Hackathon! In this hackathon, we've tackled the challenges presented by programming a 2R manipulator, RoboRig, through a series of tasks involving navigation and trajectory following.

## Team Members
- Pranjal Gaur
- Aditya Mehta 

## Project Structure
Our project is structured as follows:
- **Level 1:** Navigating the Cartesian Plane
- **Level 2:** Following the Smooth Trajectory

## File Structure
- **code:** This directory contains the Python scripts for each level of the challenge.
- **simulation_results:** Here, you can find the simulation results in the form of CSV files.
- **README.md:** You are currently reading this file, which provides an overview of our project.

## How to Run
To run the code and visualize the simulation results, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the desired level (e.g., Level 1 or Level 2).
3. Run the Python script using a Python interpreter.
4. View the simulation results to assess the performance of RoboRig.

## Level 1: Navigating the Cartesian Plane
In this level, our task was to guide RoboRig to a specified position on the Cartesian plane. The code for this level can be found in the `code/level1.py` file.

## Level 2: Following the Smooth Trajectory
For the second level, we programmed RoboRig to follow a circular trajectory with precision and smoothness. The code for this level can be found in the `code/level2.py` file.

## Simulation Results
The simulation results for each level are stored in the `simulation_results` directory. Each CSV file contains three columns: time, X-coordinate, and Y-coordinate.

## Conclusion
We hope you enjoy exploring our submission for the RoboRig Adventure Hackathon! Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or feedback.

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this exciting event!
